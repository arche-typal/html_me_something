					<p>The piece was made using ink and watercolors. Watercolors are useful for creating a very smokey, faded, ethereal look. The ink is used to intensify certain areas of the painting such as the eyes, other facial features, and pattern on the collar.</p>

					<p>The are a lot of aesthetic features about the sea. Various coral in particular is fun to look at. When creating this piece the colors were meant to be very vivid. The entire piece is moving away from photorealism to a more surreal realm by collaging nature with portraits. Incorporating the abstract appeareance of coral worked well for this.</p>

					<p>This is a sculptural portrait using a clay face mold and various "junk" laying around the studio. There is something pleasurable about taking everyday, mundane objects that have been cast away and incorporating them into something personally meaningful.</p>
